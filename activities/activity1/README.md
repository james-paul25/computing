**Meme Concept – CCJ Intramurals Victory**

----

This meme celebrates the College of Criminal Justice (CCJ) winning the Intramurals Grand Champion title. It playfully highlights how CTAS and CCIS did not secure the overall win, while emphasizing CCJ’s dominance not only in sports and competitions but also in the prestigious Mr. & Ms. Intramurals Pageant.

The concept combines humor with school pride, making it relatable to students who experienced the paugnat ug pasundayag (competitions and performances) of the intramurals. The meme theme is victory + playful rivalry, showing CCJ’s big moment as the spotlight of the event.
